# Monkeypox-Watch - Welcome!
Welcome to my data visualization app on the spread of the monkeypox virus. This is the first major outbreak of the virus that is being tracked worldwide, and as such data is made available. 
The only issue is that unlike wide spreading pandemics such as COVID, the data on the monkeypox is very limited. 
However, with those limitations in mind, I thought it might still be handy to produce an app that can display the fragmented data in a simple, and easily understood manner. 

You can view the app using this link: https://ymahmoud1-monkeypox-watch-app-1ft3py.streamlitapp.com/

**OR

You can clone the repository, install all the modules found in the requirements file and then in the directory run the command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
